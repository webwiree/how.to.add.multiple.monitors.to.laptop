There are a few ways to connect multiple monitors to a laptop; however all of them require an operating system that supports multiple monitors and a video card that supports multiple monitor mode. Here are some tips.

### Using the Second VGA Output of the Laptop

On most laptop computers, you can easily spot the VGA port for adding an external monitor. It should be noted that the default setting for any device added to the VGA port is the mirroring of the screen and not multi mode.

If your laptop comes with a video card or chipset installed that is capable of supporting multi monitors, you can easily choose this setting instead of the default mirror setting.

### Adding a Monitor via USB

You can add one or more monitors to your laptop computer via the USB ports. Some monitors that are sold today can connect via USB instead of through a larger VGA port. However, in order to realize multi monitor images, your chipset or video card will need to have multi mode capability.

### Adding a PCMCIA Video Card

Since practically all laptops have PCMCIA support, you can usually add multi monitor support by installing a PCMCIA video card with this capability. Remember, with a PCMCIA card, you just need to easily insert the card into the laptop PCMCIA slot. It should be noted that to ensure the video card is working properly with your operating system, you may need to download the current driver.

### Using a Docking Station with Video Card

If you have access to a docking station for your laptop and it includes a video card with multi mode capability, you can obviously use the docking station to connect your laptop to additional monitors. For instance, one docking station that has a built in video card with multi mode capability is EasiDock 1000EV. Some docking stationshave the capability of adding or installing a video card with multi mode capability. In this case, you can easily install a video card to the docking station and then connect your laptop to acquire multi mode capability.

### Adding an External Video Card

There are devices that can be connected to your laptop that include an external video card. Some devices can be connected via a PCMCIA card; others can be connected via USB.

### Using a Second Laptop or Other PC as an Additional Monitor

In certain situations, you can use a second laptop's screen or a desktop PC's monitor to add multi mode capability. The second laptop or desktop PC can be connected to the laptop via a network connection. You may do this either via Ethernet or even WiFi. It should be noted that you will need at least Windows 2000, XP or Vista. In addition you may need special software. One software application that can give you this capability is MaxiVista
